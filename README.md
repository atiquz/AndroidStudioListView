# Android Studio ListView Example

This Android Studio project demonstrates the implementation of a simple ListView with clickable items. The app displays a list of cities, and when a city is clicked, a toast message is shown to indicate the selected city.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/atiquz/AndroidStudioListView
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Choose "Open an existing Android Studio project."
   - Navigate to the cloned project and select the `AndroidStudioListView` directory.

3. **Run the App:**
   - Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
   - Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`app` Module:**
  - `src/main/java/com/atidevelopers/androidstudiolistview/MainActivity.java`: Contains the main activity code, including the ListView setup and item click handling.

  - `src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`: Defines the layout of the main activity, including the ListView widget.

  - `src/main/res/values/strings.xml`: Contains string resources, including the array of city names.

## Dependencies

- The project does not have any additional dependencies beyond the default Android dependencies.

## How It Works

1. The `MainActivity` class initializes the ListView and populates it with an array of city names using an `ArrayAdapter`.

2. The `setOnItemClickListener` method is used to listen for item clicks on the ListView.

3. When a city is clicked, a toast message is displayed, indicating the selected city.
